<p><a href="http://www.powerdns.com/" target="_blank">Powerdns</a> is a very nice DNS server. It provides out of the box Geo sensitivity, enabling you to redirect your customer to different servers according to their origin. We use that we a quite complex zone setup.</p>
<p>Also it can be plugged onto a SQL backend (such as mysql, postgresql or sqlite). The whole stuff can then be managed by dedicated web tools. We use pdnsadmin (php based, requires mysql) and this is enough for simple uses.</p>
