It's been a nice ride.

#### Landing at fotopedia

I was hired at fotopedia in 2010, as a Server Architect. My recruitment here was mostly done thanks to Kali and Ber. I had been working with Kali for almost 10 years at [IDM][1] and he had left a little bit more than one year before I did.

My first meeting with the team was in pub around a beer, with Kali and Ber who managed to make me feel at ease.
