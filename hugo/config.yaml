    title: Welcome to my site!
    content: | 
      I'm Pierre Baillet (aka _Oct_), a programmer who's been in love with coding since my early days tinkering with an Atari ST and GFA-Basic.

      My digital playground is a bit chaotic - I create projects that are part passion, part experiment. Some stick around in production, some quietly fade away. But that's the beauty of coding, right? Always exploring, always learning.

      What you'll find here:

      * Bits of code and tech musings,
      * Projects that are more "works in progress" than polished gems
      * Thoughts shared in both English and French 🇬🇧🇫🇷

      Welcome to my little corner of the internet - where imperfect code meets endless curiosity!

      Coding isn't just what I do, it's who I am. 🖥️
