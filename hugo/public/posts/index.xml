      <description>How I&amp;rsquo;m currently blocking Ads at home, and why? In this article, I&amp;rsquo;m writing about the various solutions I&amp;rsquo;ve recently explored to block ads and I also describe the solution I&amp;rsquo;m currently using!
Pi-hole Pi-hole is a cool open source project to block ads on your whole network. You set this up on a small Raspberry Pi (hence the name, heh), and then reconfigure your internet to use the pi-hole as your primary DNS, it will then nuke carefully all DNS requests sent to this tracking and ads endpoint.</description>

      <description>This article is pretty old, so be careful as its information could be out of date!
 this article is for macOS only.
If you use git and gpg to sign your commits, then you&amp;rsquo;re probably used to sign you commits using a physical key that you have to insert and press with your finger when you are creating a commit.
Unfortunately, there is no visible feedback in the console when git awaits for a yubikey touch and this means that you can sometime miss these.</description>

      <description>If you have been doing a bit of Ansible, there is probably some coding style that has emerged from your work, especially if you work in a team around the same code. During my time as an Ansible developer, I had the opportunity to collect some tips I use on a regular basis when writing scripts. These tips will probably help you save some time.
I assume that you already know Ansible, Playbooks, YAML syntax and Ansible Galaxy roles.</description>

      <description>Tech  Ellie is a nice webapp that allows prototyping of Elm-lang based applications. Elm is a javascript alternative, looks a lot like Haskell. Track your vehicle using using a ODB dongle, nice way to have a connected car. an iOS alternative that can probably do the job at last for some prototyping, or connected self: SensorLog by Bernd Thomas. I just need a PaaS to store the data and render them.</description>
