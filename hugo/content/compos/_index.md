title: Compositions
summary: The Music I create
---

In 2025, I started composing music using hardware synthetizers, something I have always wanted to experiment in my life. This lead to 
a lot of discoveries on how this world of other-computers is working, including all the related headaches when you want to connect
different pieces of gear together.

## Gear

Right now, my setup is:

- A [Roland SH-4D](https://amzn.to/46BTerG), 4 voice Synth with a kit track. Powerful and deep, it's a very nice and polished machine I'm still exploring (a new firmware went out this year and I'm still digging in the docs),
- A [Pocket Operator Arcade](https://amzn.to/4gxq4hL), blip-blop machine, outputting nice 8bits sounds. Very fun,
- A [Korg Volca Drum](https://amzn.to/4221WOy) I bought almost randomly. Seems like a very nice synthetic drum machine, full of potential,
- A [Livetrak l6](https://amzn.to/423Lopc) to connect all these things together and to my Mac. I love this mixer,
- A [Novation Circuit Rhythm](https://amzn.to/3IzDfCe) (second hand), bought for its sampling capabilities, I enjoy its simple but OK sequencer with its song mode. A bit too much on the Hip Hop side for me, but still very fun to use,
- A pair of [DT900 Pro X](https://amzn.to/427Cabv) (second hand) to monitor all that. The Open version so that my wife can talk to me when I'm working without having to shout through the sounds.


Gear I sold:
- [Novation Mininova](https://amzn.to/47UC8HH). Too much of a piano for me and with my low skills, it was mostly useless (and too large for my Desk).

## Software

I'm not a real fan of DAWs so far, but I've been working a bit with [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/), [Renoise](https://www.renoise.com/) and the amazing [Stepic VST Plugin](https://devicemeister.com/). Stepic itself almost justify using a computer.
