If your IIS doesn't want to start and does not give you any error. Just try to reinstall it: uninstall it from the add/remove programs and add it again.

Made my day.

Kudos to the <a href="http://databaseforum.info/8/3/ac16d34e6fe39c78.html">databaseforum</a> for the fix I was looking for in the internet.
