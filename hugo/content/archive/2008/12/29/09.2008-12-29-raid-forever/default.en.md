MegaCLI (LSI) PERC Command line client is <a href="http://www.lsi.com/DistributionSystem/AssetDocument/support/downloads/megaraid/miscellaneous/linux/2.00.12_Linux_Cli.zip">here</a> in case you're looking for it too. This is a zip containing a zip containing an rpm file. Just alien it and you're almost done. The <a href="http://www.docstoc.com/docs/477297/DELL-PERC5i-Integrated---Emergency-Cheat-Sheet">cheats sheet you can find on the internet</a> is rather ok, except for the download link I just wrote down.
