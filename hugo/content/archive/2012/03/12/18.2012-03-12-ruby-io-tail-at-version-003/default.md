The new version of ruby-io-tail will start to tail files from the end, and not from the first line available. This is useful to ensure no lines is sent twice to the Tailing application.<br />
<br />
As usual, the gem is available from:&nbsp;<a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/io-tail">https://rubygems.org/gems/io-tail</a>
