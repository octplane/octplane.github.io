### Trail Router

This small app will generate trail routes so that you can run outside of car busy roads and have a nice and green journey. It's a free app that allows to pick a start and end of track, its lengths and some other parameter. It will then show you several routes that are matching your settings. I tried it while I was in [Noirmoutier](https://www.google.fr/maps/place/Noirmoutier/@46.9615364,-2.3096809,12z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x4805112d6cedcfa9:0xac8ae5c257a65c90!8m2!3d46.9872475!4d-2.2692823!16zL20vMDZzZHcy?entry=ttu) and it worked very well. Try it!
