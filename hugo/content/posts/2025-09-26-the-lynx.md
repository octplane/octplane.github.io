We had a [Lynx from Atari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_Lynx) when we were young. Well, correction, my brother had a Lynx and I was just a guest there. But nevertheless, it was an amazing console we enjoyed a lot until the AC adapter started wiggling and finally broke (I think). All the difficulty was to keep enough battery on the way to BTZ when playing in the car (the car cigarette lighter was maybe not that great, I'm not sure I remember well...).

Anyway, I played a few of these games again using emulation a few months ago and this was a blast (from the past). 

The game we owned:

- [The Amazing California Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Games)
- My favorite: [Rampart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rampart_(video_game))
- My bro's favorite: [Warbirds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warbirds_(video_game))
- [Batman Returns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batman_Returns_(Atari_Lynx_video_game))
- [Electrocop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrocop) 
- [Ninja Gaiden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninja_Gaiden_(arcade_game))
- [Xenophobe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenophobe_(video_game))
