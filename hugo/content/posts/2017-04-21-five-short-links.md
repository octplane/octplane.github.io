## Tech
- [remote attack on an ODB dongle](https://argus-sec.com/remote-attack-bosch-drivelog-connector-dongle/), follow-up of [last week links](/blog/2017-04-14):  It was obvious this will lead to some dirty exploitation.
- on [Recursion, Continuations and Trampolines](http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2017/on-recursion-continuations-and-trampolines/), an excellent in-depth article that speaks about tail call optimization and all these way to avoid exhausting the stack.
- [how r/places ](https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/656z8t/how_we_built_rplace/) was built for reddit 1st of April event. Technical and inspiring. Real life challenges :)

## Culture

- a simple [RPG rule system](https://www.dungeon-gazette.com/rule-systems/spartans/) you can use anywhere.
- [pink Trombone, a human throat and voice simulator](https://dood.al/pinktrombone/) . Hilarious and interesting...

## Personal life

My kid is just born. I'm now a father!
