# Tech
- [Ellie](https://ellie-app.com) is a nice webapp that allows prototyping of Elm-lang based applications. [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) is a javascript alternative, looks a lot like Haskell.
- Track your vehicle using using a [ODB dongle](https://www.munic.io/products), nice way to have a connected car.
- an iOS alternative that can probably do the job at last for some prototyping, or connected self: [SensorLog by Bernd Thomas](https://appsto.re/fr/Thkix.i). I just need a PaaS to store the data and render them.

# Culture

- Spotify recommendations sent me to [Tagada Jones](https://open.spotify.com/album/50uuwku9CNQJBPE26OoaUL)'s newest album. French PUNK!
- [Les braqueurs](http://pca.st/L9zA), an amazing French spoken podcast, featuring testimonies of real gangsters. Amazing!
