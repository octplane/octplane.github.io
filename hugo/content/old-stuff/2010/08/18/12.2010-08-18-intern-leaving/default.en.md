Today, our intern Wilfred is going away after 5 or 6 weeks of internship. He worked on monitoring the Google page rank of our pages, and of given keywords we want to follow at Fotopedia. Of course, he mainly did ruby code, with mongo, redis/resque and protoviz graphs.

We are now almost able to identify the progress of the rank of most of our page across time. This will be very useful in a near future.


It was a pleasure to work with him. I wish him good luck in his studies and later in his professional life!


Bon Vent Wilfred :)
