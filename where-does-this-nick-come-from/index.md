Oct is the shorthand for Octplane, which is in turn a mutation of BitPlane which was my pseudo when I was a teenage programmer discovering GFA-Basic and asm on the Atari STF. When I bought my first PC, I decided to raise the number of available bits on the screen, going from bit to oct.

My real name is Pierre Baillet and this explains the original nickname I gave to myself when I was 16, not knowing that it would also be the one people I work with still use when addressing to me more than 20 years later.@: Sans titre
